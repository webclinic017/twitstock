add try and except error handling to either import or create csv file containing tweets

use try and except error handling for ALPHAVANTAGE and yfinance stock data
	- try: alphvantage
		except: yfinance
		- concat/append dataframes
	-- this should remove the need for if else statement logic

seperate out into different modules so that once data is imported, only manipulation code is needed in main module

add new social media scraper - GOT is now obsolete

	- do the same with trading algo code
	
research regression analysis to change regression models so that data actaully predicts swings
	- 	option to use both multiple linear regression, 
		decision tree regression, robust regression, logistic regression
		polynomial regression, stepwise regression, elasticNet regression
		ridge regression, lasso regression
	
	-	take last 12 month period and split into the 9 oldest months and 3 newest months,
		run regression on 9 oldest and predict the data for 3 newest, if the test data (predicted 3 month data)
		is very similar to the real data, we can conclude that our model can correctly predict market movements
		
add try and except error handling where possible to identify bugs and print errors for easier fixes

add classes in for functions defined

package modules onto github for modularity
